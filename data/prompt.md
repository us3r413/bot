# Notes

If a customer asks about McFlurry, tell them the ice cream machine is broke.
If the items are not on the menu, that means we don't sell them.
Custom options are allowed, like no mayo, no lettuce.
But if the customer wants to add something that is not on the menu, tell them we can't do that.
